# Blood-Bank-Management-System-
*ABSTRACT*

This paper contains a list of system specifications, a database architecture, a basic definition of the methods, and an overview of how to incorporate a blood donation management system. The aim of this project is to develop a database management framework capable of enabling the stress-free management and coordination of a blood donor database that can be quickly incorporated in NGOs.

*SUMMARY*

The importance and need of blood at the correct time cannot be overstated at such a period (Covid-19). The basic aim of this project was to make a database with capabilities to be useful in such times. It revolves around three types of users- donor, recipient and blood bank administrators.

*GENERAL DESCRIPTION*

The blood donation system we aim to build with the implementation of our database would aim to facilitate the easy and efficient connection of blood donors and recipients to blood-banks. The system would register users in three groups namely, a donor, recipient and a blood bank. Our users will be classified into persons (donor and recipient) and organizations (blood-banks). We would record static locations of all users and aim to provide the most appropriate solution, taking into account distance. Persons will have their medical history and blood group recorded and made available to aid the efficiency of the system. Organizations will have their activity history recorded for accountability and references.

*REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS*

An efficient blood bank database would aim to easily connect potential donors with blood-banks, blood-banks with potential recipients and vice versa. The potential donors would be connected with their nearest blood bank. The data of potential donors will be stored according to their blood types, disease history and proximity to nearest blood-bank in the database.

Another Objective of the database is to register and store blood-banks by their location in order for them to be connected to potential donors and recipient with ease. The blood banks aim to receive and give out blood from people in need (recipients) closest to them. The blood banks record the instances of blood received according to the blood group received, location and past illnesses associated with donor. The banks also record the instances of blood given out according to similar criteria, replacing past illnesses with reason for requesting blood.

The blood recipient would need to be connected to a bank which possesses his blood in the closest proximity to him. The recipient would provide details of the blood type requested, reason for request and location.â€ƒ
